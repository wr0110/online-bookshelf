### **Bookmark | Your Online Bookshelf**

Bookmark is a bookmarking application that allows readers to create an online bookshelf, to help track and organize their books/reads in a central location.

## Description

Bookmark is a bookmarking application, made for avid readers, that allows them to create their online bookshelf. The aim of Bookmark is to help readers and other book enthusiasts, track and organize their reads in a central location online. Users can search for authors and their books and add them to their library in the desired catetory : **To Be Read, In Progress or Completed**.

Bookmark uses Firebase and consumes their Authentication and Database services. This enables users to login with their google account and save and access their data in realtime. Once logged in, users can start adding to their library.

## Motivation

As an avid reader, I found it difficult to keep track of all my books, book recommendations or reading lists since I just kept a list in my notes app or I scribbled it on whatever I could find nearby. This method was not effective as it was unorganized and unreliable. It became clear to me that I needed an easier, more functional way to organize all my reads, and so I created Bookmark with the aim of solving this problem.
